q2
$ mips-linux-gnu-gcc -S -mno-explicit-relocs gcd.c 
$ ./remove_asm_directives.pl gcd.s gcd-noopt.s

q3
$ spim
(spim) load "gcd-noopt.s"
(spim) load "asmutils.s"
(spim) run
b)
first tried for 200,175,150
next increased 165
next decresed 160,155
finally 151
checked by step 150
again step gives final step beacuse after this step gives first instruction only,
in this first 6 instructions are for loading before running main programming
6+142(from code)+3(end of code)=151


q4
$ mips-linux-gnu-gcc -O1 -fno-delayed-branch -S -mno-explicit-relocs gcd.c 
$ ./remove_asm_directives.pl gcd.s gcd-opt.s

b)
6(default)+  64(code instructions) +3(defualt)
